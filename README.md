About me


Hello, I'm Oleksandr Nikonov

I have been passionate about computers since childhood. Programming became part of my life more than six years ago — back in school, I was already writing my first programs in Python.

I graduated from university and hold a degree in computer science. I can program in Python and C++, and I also have knowledge of JavaScript and React. I am continuously learning new frameworks and technologies.

I enjoy developing websites, have experience working with SQL, and creating virtual machines in VirtualBox.

I learn quickly — if something is explained to me once, I will remember and be able to complete the task independently. I learn best through hands-on experience and practical projects.
